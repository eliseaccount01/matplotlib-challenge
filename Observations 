Observations: 

1. Capomulin has the highest survival rate over the 45 day treatment. 
2. The placebo and the other two drugs, Ketapril and Infubinol, have around the same effects for treatment. 
3. Infubinol after day 30 of treatment had a rapid decline in survival rates compared to Ketepril and EVEN the PLACEBO!(My oh my, I think the Placebo would be better to take as no negative side affects compared to Infubinol and Ketepril!)
